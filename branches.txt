This will keep informations about the branches

create separate branches for each stage of development
separate different end goals of your project
create separate development path without overriding progress

git checkout -b "name"--> crear una branch
get checkout "name" --> cambiar a alguna branch
git branche ""
git branch -a --> list branches
git branch -d --> delete branches


Merging branch

git merge "name"  --> merge the especifided branch into the current branch


It let you work with great exponential growth

merging only takes the last commit of the source branch
